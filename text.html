        <h1>What is technology really?</h1>
        <div class="text">
            <p>Technology ("science of craft", from Greek τέχνη, techne, "art, skill, cunning of hand"; and -λογία, -logia[2])
                is the sum of techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the
                accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques,
                processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines to allow for operation without detailed knowledge
                of their workings. Systems (e.g. machines) applying technology by taking an input, changing it according to
                the system's use, and then producing an outcome are referred to as technology systems or technological systems.
                The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools. The prehistoric invention of shaped stone
                tools followed by the discovery of how to control fire increased sources of food. The later Neolithic Revolution
                extended this, and quadrupled the sustenance available from a territory. The invention of the wheel helped humans
                to travel in and control their environment.
